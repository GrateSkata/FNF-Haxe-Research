# this log notes my research on mobile support of the game. there is leftover and unused code that can be possibly reused and reimplemented.

first, check the code in your project.xml file. this could take a moment to find and read, so here's a rundown.
  <!--Disable the right and middle mouse buttons-->
	<!-- <haxedef name="FLX_NO_MOUSE_ADVANCED" /> -->
  <!--Optimise inputs, be careful you will get null errors if you don't use conditionals in your game-->
	<!-- <haxedef name="FLX_NO_MOUSE" if="mobile" /> -->
	<!-- <haxedef name="FLX_NO_KEYBOARD" if="mobile" /> -->
	<!-- <haxedef name="FLX_NO_TOUCH" if="desktop" /> -->
	<!--<haxedef name="FLX_NO_GAMEPAD" />-->
  
  # i will optimize this code, and you can see some optimizations have been made and you can now add this to your project.xml code.
  <!--Disable the right and middle mouse buttons-->
	
	<!-- <haxedef name="FLX_NO_MOUSE"/> -->
	<!-- <haxedef name="FLX_NO_TOUCH" /> -->
	<!--<haxedef name="FLX_NO_GAMEPAD" />-->
  
 # as you can see, i have changed some lines, and changed some code so that now, you can use all of your mouse keys during the game. this may be unstable as it hasn't been tested.
 you can also now click on your note strum to hit notes! again, this remains untested, and can probably not work. clicking on the note strum to hit notes is my hypothesis.
 i'll maybe test these unused code elements in a few weeks/days to see if i'm correct. for reasons, i'm currently writing 7/2/21.
