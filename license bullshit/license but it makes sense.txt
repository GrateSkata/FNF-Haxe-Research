if you hate reading tos shit like licenses, here's what you can do with my code:
modify it
distribute it in different forms
use it for commercial use
here's what you can't do with my code:
steal and redistribute it and crediting yourself for making it
use it 3rd party (this code is made for Friday Night Funkin' and Friday Night Funkin' only)
sell it online for a price (this code is free and is just research, do not sell things that are already free)

now that this dumb shit is done, enjoy my code
