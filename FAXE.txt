# this file documents my research on unused code in Friday Night Funkin' which runs on haxeflixel.
in the project.xml file, there are unused libraries you can download and enable for windows/linux etc. clients.
# FAXE
faxe was a planned audio module (what i assume to be) for the nintendo switch port of FNF. unfortunately, that port was declined by nintendo.
to recover FAXE and it's code (adding it as a plugin to haxe) run the following commands:
haxelib git faxe https://github.com/uhrobots/faxe
lime rebuild faxe windows
go to project.xml and look for code:
<haxelib name="faxe" if='switch'/>
remove code:
if='switch'
the faxe code should become this:
<haxelib name="faxe"/>
# faxe is recovered and useable.
