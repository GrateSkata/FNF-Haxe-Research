HXCPP DEBUG SERVER, MARKDOWN, HTMLPARSER, NAPE HAXE4

these are simple to reinstall, but i have a small rundown on what one of them does:
haxelib install nape-haxe4
lime rebuild nape-haxe4 windows
haxelib install markdown
lime rebuild markdown windows
haxelib install HtmlParser
lime rebuild HtmlParser windows
haxelib install hxcpp-debug-server
lime rebuild hxcpp-debug-server windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the HXCPP debug server could potentially be used for debug copies of Friday Night Funkin. this library could possibly load extra extensions ifnot better load the debug mode. 
just so you aren't confused, debug mode as in haxeflixel debug mode. not the charter provided in every copy of the game created. now that this is out of the way, you can move on and read about more of my research on FNF haxeflixel code.
